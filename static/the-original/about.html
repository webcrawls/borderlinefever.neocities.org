            <p>International Dream-Surfrock wave Borderline Fever is a band made by a ragtag group of fellas that are
                just
                here to have a good time ðŸ™‚</p>
            <p>From a small town area in Ontario, Canada. These 4 members have a knack for making great music and having
                a
                damn good time doing it. The band started in May of 2021.</p>
            <p>With Drew on the drums, Julia on rhythm and
                vocals, Darius on Main, and Tyler on bass; these four create a vibe that is unstoppable and unparalleled
                by
                even the greats.</p>
            <p>Or maybe not idk just listen and find out for yourself dummy!!</p>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Where it all began. Front-runner and musician extraordinaire, Julia comes in swinging with riffs that
                will rock your socks off and the voice of an angel. Julia never disappoints with her creativity and
                knack for cooking up something good. Armed to the teeth with musical abilities, she would make rock
                legends go into an early retirement.</p>

                <h1 class="member-title title">Drew</h1>
            </div>
            <p>BLF's master percussionist, Drew lays down the rhythm for which the band builds its masterpieces atop of.
                Drew takes advantage of his black-belt level drum training and his grueling practice regime (or whenever
                he gets the chance) to make beats that blow the greats out of the water. He also likes to sew.</p>

            </div>
            <p>big man; guitar legend; master on the strings. All terms that could be used to describe Blf's lead
                guitarist if it was somebody else. After being invited to help forge the best musical group on this side
                of the planet because he was goofy, Darius swore a sacred oath to do "just good enough to not get kicked
                out". With the help of a guitar that costs about as much as Toronto rent, his angelic riffs would be
                enough to turn anyone's ear in the direction of Borderline Fever.</p>

                <h1 class="member-title title">Tyler</h1>
            </div>
            <p>The big man with a master plan. The title held by BLFs own bassist. After being asked to join the band,
                Tyler had to set out on a journey to learn bass as he had never played. Did he learn? Who's to say!! But
                if the stars align and the mood is right, if you listen really close; you still won't find the answer
                !!</p>
